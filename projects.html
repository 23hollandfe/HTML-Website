     <h1>My Research Project</h1>
     <img src="https://truesyncmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TrueSync-Media-Black.png">
     <p class="q">I researched TrueSync for a presentation in APCSP. It is a new technology programed to improve the look and process of dubbing films in foreign languages. It uses AI to gather data on the actor's facial expressions, and the translator's lip movements. It then generates new fotage that maintains the original actor's style and the background, while incorporating the lip movements of the translator. To complete this research I spent lots of time reading articles as well as creating a presentation of the information I gathered. I find it incredibly interesting and important that Truesync was made because it increases the accessibility of foriegn films to new audiences.</p>

     <h1> Isearch Project</h1>
    <img src="Isearch.png">
      <p class="q"> I researched the criminal justice system for the Isearch project in English class my freshman year of highschool. The Isearch was an 18 page paper about a topic of our choice. I focused on the problems in the justice system that result in wrongful convictions. I discovered that many of the issue are cause by false accusationa dn mistaken identification due to racism and bias. In order to solve the problem, we need to raise awarenesss of the ruined lives of the wrongfully accused, and petition for better legal representation of those convicted. This project involved me gathering information from interviews, readings, and films.</p>
